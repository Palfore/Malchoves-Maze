# Malchoves-Maze
This was one of the first programs I wrote, so don't judge the code too hard!

Game.c / Game.exe is the first version which has the most content.
Redesign.c / Redesign.exe is the second version that has less content, but makes use of structs to improve the organization.

I'm not sure what version of gcc this was originally compiled with, but it can be compiled with GCC 8.2.0.
Additionally, these only work on windows since there are some windows specific libaries used to improve the command line interface / display.
