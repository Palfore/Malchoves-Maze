{talk crazy! I've had enough of that already
{today!
Palfore: Thank you...
         So, let us start at the beginning...
>`
Palfore: It all started over 100 years ago.
         Damadaeus, was the protecter of our land...
         He was a great powerhouse of a man!
         He could move boulder with the touch of fin-
}: BOOOOOORRRRRRING! Move on!
Palfore: /././.
Palfore: Very well...
         DeMalae was the main reason we needed a
         protector. He's wicked necromancer...
         He started off weak, decaying the
         occasional leaf, but his power has grown
         unbounded. Recently he managed to defeat
         Damadaeus. I/././. I don't know how, he
         was always so jealous of Damadaeus' power!
>`
***0012***
Palfore: Regardless, Damadaeus constantly embued
         Adrea to protect us from necromancy.
         Without Damadeaus, Adrea will continue to
         decay And our protection agaisnt those
         fiends will disapear...
         This is why we need you }...
>`
}: Why me? What could I do??
{You seem a lot more able!
Palfore: BAHE-HAEEeeee! *he whezzes a laugh*
         I'm far too old, I need you to go
         see the Oracle to the EAST!
         Please... The world is in your hands...
}: But I'm/././. I don't kn-
Palfore: GO! Time is running out!
}: Where should I go?
{Oh! There's an opening in the trees!
{I must have missed it.
{Maybe the Oracle is there!
>`
***0013***
Palfore: What are you doing?! Go find the Oracle!
>`
***0014***
}: The tree looks very ill...
>`
***0015***
Oracle: So, you have found me.
        Then is it true,
        that it is I who found you too?
>`
***0016***
Oracle: Hmmm... You haven't solved my riddle yet...
